Part I: The Schema.
2. Is this database in Normal Form?
	If so, which one is it in? 1NF, 2NF, 3NF?
	If not, what is preventing it from being normalized? Can it be normalized?

Answer: This database is in Normal Form:
	
	1)The "city" table is 1NF. As per the rule of first normal form, 
	  an attribute (column) of a table cannot hold multiple values. 
	  It should hold only atomic values.
	2) The "country" table and the "countrylanguage" table are 3NF. A table design is said to be in 3NF if both the following conditions hold:
		Table must be in 2NF
		Transitive functional dependency of non-prime attribute on any super key should be removed.
	   An attribute that is not part of any candidate key is known as non-prime attribute.
	   A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and for each functional dependency X-> Y at least one of the following conditions hold:
		X is a super key of table (EX: {code, capital, name, continent. region,...})
		Y is a prime attribute of table (EX: {countrycode})
